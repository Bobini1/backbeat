# Backbeat

Backbeat is a standard for getting and storing rhythm game charts.

It can be trivially integrated with any game, frequently has faster performance than the filesystem for games like BMS, and de-duplicates files to save disk space and download times.

**If you're just someone that plays rhythm games, you can install [the Backbeat App](https://backbeat.ac) and then click `Download with Backbeat` buttons on websites.** Beyond that you shouldn't need to know or care about Backbeat - everything else here is technical crap for nerds.

### Install on macOS with Homebrew

```sh
brew tap zkldi/backbeat https://github.com/zkldi/backbeat
brew install --cask backbeat
```

Backbeat is currently unsigned. If macOS blocks the first launch, try opening
Backbeat and then select **Open Anyway** under **System Settings → Privacy &
Security**.

It also comes with support for Packs, Difficulty Tables and Courses, which are ways to arrange rhythm game charts. Games that integrate Backbeat get these powerful features, _for free_.

You never again have to faff around with google drive links, trawling discord, and unraring files in the right locale.

## What it is not.

Backbeat is not a Rhythm Game, and it's not a replacement for a "Songs" folder on your PC.

**Games that integrate with Backbeat MUST keep their support for their regular read-game-content-from-disk, as it is absolutely necessary for content creators.**

It has **absolutely no support** for editing content, by design, so it will _never_ be possible for a chart editor to sensibly work with it. Backbeat is intended for distributing **finished, immutable content.**

## Games that support Backbeat:

- All of them. Backbeat is game-agnostic, and works with any game that has been written, or will be written. The protocol has no game-specific logic.

## Clients that integrate Backbeat:

- Tentatively, lr2oraja-endlessdream
- Tentatively, unnamed-sdvx-clone
- (Your game, here?)

## Backbeat Servers:

- [Makiba](https://makiba.ac)

Makiba is the largest chart database ever made, and it speaks Backbeat. Just add `https://makiba.ac` to your list of data servers.
