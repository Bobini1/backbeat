# Backbeat SDK

Backbeat is a standard for sharing and storing rhythm game charts in an efficient, easy, distributed manner.

This crate is the core API for developing with Backbeat.

[Docs](https://docs.rs/backbeat_sdk)

[More info](https://backbeat.ac/docs)

If you are a game client written in Rust, you can add this:

```sh
cargo add backbeat_sdk
```

and you are off to the races!

If you're not written in Rust, you can use the C SDK instead,
see the [backbeat_c_sdk](https://github.com/zkldi/backbeat/tree/main/rust/backbeat_c_sdk).

## Usage

Generally speaking, take a look at the [`Backbeat`] struct. It's the centerpiece of this API, and is all you really need.

```sh
cargo add backbeat_sdk backbeat_core
cargo add tokio --features macros,rt-multi-thread
```

Here's a quick tour:

```rust,no_run
use backbeat_core::ChartId;
use backbeat_sdk::{AssetData, Backbeat};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
	// You just open the store - don't worry about configuring anything or creating it.
	let store = Backbeat::open()?;

	// basic stats
	let stats = store.stats()?;
	println!("{} charts, {} assets", stats.charts, stats.asset_count);

	// lets download a chart off the internet by sha256
	//
	// This automatically uses whatever the user has configured
	// to be their data servers.
	let chart_id: ChartId = "sha256/4842b24fecaa8a53dbcdc4f05f6fc919a2a2089d762d5f93144a4e1a97a1248a".parse()?;
	store.server_download_chart(&chart_id).await?;

	// get the downloaded bundle from your store
	let bundle = store.get_chart(&chart_id)?;
	let bundle_id = bundle.bundle_id();

	println!("chart has {} assets", bundle.assets.len());

	// Do asset lookups. When this chart asks for "You Suffer.mp3", call this function
	// to figure out what bytes you should use!
	let asset_data = store.resolve_asset(bundle_id, "You Suffer.mp3")?;

	// small assets are inlined into memory.
	//
	// Your game will need to handle both!
	match asset_data {
		AssetData::Bytes(b) => {
			println!("You Suffer.mp3 is an inlined file with {} bytes", b.len());
		},
		AssetData::File(path) => {
			let b = std::fs::read(path)?;
			println!("You Suffer.mp3 is stored on-disk, and is {} bytes", b.len());
		}
	}

	Ok(())
}
```

## Database API

The `backbeat.db` file is considered a stable part of the API for backbeat. You are allowed to do any read-only query from it.

Writing directly to the backbeat database is explicitly illegal. Do not do this, for any reason. You have to go very far out of your way to get a writable connection to the DB, so please don't.

The database API is as follows, you get read-only access to exactly these tables:

```sql
-- Backbeat will increment `refresh.revision` this whenever data has changed.
-- The value wraps around at 9_000_000_000_000_000_000, but that's fine.
--
-- This is how you listen for store changes. It's the simplest thing,
-- but it works so well, no process state or anything like that.
CREATE TABLE "refresh" (
	-- pointless column just to ensure we have one row of this
	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CHECK (id = 1),

	-- backbeat increments this when content is installed/removed/whatever.
	-- TL;DR this is the "should refresh" value.
	revision INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (revision >= 0)
) STRICT;
INSERT INTO refresh(id, revision) VALUES (1, 0);

-- Chart contents stored by sha256.
CREATE TABLE "chart_data" (
	sha256 TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	-- The actual chart bytes, **gzip-compressed** for storage reasons.
	gzip_data BLOB NOT NULL,
	uncompressed_size INTEGER NOT NULL
) STRICT;

-- Extra chartIDs associated with a chart.
--
-- Backbeat enforces that `sha256` is calculated for every chart,
-- but also calculates some additional chart ID algorithms for
-- certain filetypes that are useful for external reasons.
--
-- The list of chart IDs supported by backbeat is baked into core.
-- To add support for a new one, update `backbeat_inspector`. At the moment,
-- only `md5` is supported as an extra algorithm, however, I anticipate there
-- to be more externally useful ones in the future.
--
-- When I was first designing this feature, we had support for "ksm-ir-hash",
-- "etterna-chartkey" and "groovestats-v3" hashes. However, all of them turned
-- out to be either unjustifiably buggy or practically unimplementable outside
-- of the games themselves. If you want to add a custom ID algorithm to backbeat
-- I think that's _awesome_ and I would love to merge it, but it has to be well
-- specified, and once merged, _cannot ever be patched again_.
